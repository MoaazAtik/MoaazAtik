### Hi, I'm Moaaz 👋

I've been enjoying Android development with Java ever since I built my first app, **"Shaky"** 👨‍💻<br>
I'm currently on the lookout for a role in Android development, ideally writing Java and XML. Writing Kotlin and Jetpack Compose is okay too because I'm learning them. If you're hiring, let's chat!
